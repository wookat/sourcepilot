TradeMind is an open-source platform for cross-border commerce sellers and developer teams. It is designed around the operational flow that happens every day: collect products, organize drafts, optimize content with AI, publish listings, and keep orders and inventory in sync.

The project currently serves two priorities: `AI product operations` and a `lightweight cross-platform ERP MVP`. Rather than trying to become a heavy all-in-one ERP, TradeMind focuses on a self-hosted, extensible foundation that teams can adapt to their own workflows.

## Release Status

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Phase | Production Capability Development In Progress |
| Demo | MVP Demo Ready |
| Observability | Standard OTLP/HTTP Export Code Ready; P5 Closure Verification Incomplete |
| Backup / Release / DR | P6 fully closed; real production verification deferred |
| Performance / Capacity | P7 Conditionally Closed; functional/development scope completed; capacity and repeatability deferred to P10 |
| Tag | Tag deferred |
| Production | Not Production Ready |
| Douyin | Douyin Release Candidate |
| Final acceptance | Final Production Acceptance Deferred to P10 |


## Positioning

| Area | What TradeMind focuses on |
| --- | --- |
| AI Product Operations | Product collection, drafts, AI titles and descriptions, image processing, and readiness checks. |
| Cross-platform ERP MVP | Store authorization, order sync, SKU matching, inventory sync, and product publishing as a practical MVP loop. |
| Self-hosted Extensibility | Provider-based architecture for AI, storage, image, platform, and collector integrations. |

## Core Capabilities

### AI Product Operations

- Product collection from 1688, Pinduoduo, Taobao / Tmall, and custom rules.
- Product draft management for products, SKUs, images, inventory thresholds, collection warnings, and readiness checks.
- AI title optimization and description generation with prompt templates, task records, compare/apply flows, and safe rollback.
- AI image workflows through remove.bg, OpenAI Image, ComfyUI, and async task queues.

### Cross-platform ERP MVP

- Store authorization with a working Douyin Shop OAuth loop, encrypted secrets, and connection tests.
- Order collaboration with sync, SKU matching, and exception handling.
- Inventory collaboration with stock mirrors, alerts, and sync tasks.
- Product publishing via a multi-platform listing center, single-product and batch draft creation, multi-product publish workflows, AI title/description review, AI image processing, draft mapping, publish tasks, recovery paths, and manual correction.
- AI customer-service reply suggestions with manual confirmation before sending.

### Engineering and Extensibility

- Provider abstractions for AI, storage, image, platform, and collector integrations.
- Self-host-friendly setup with PostgreSQL + Redis and a full Docker Compose deployment path.
- Monorepo structure for backend, admin, collector, and docs, making team collaboration easier.
- Reliability foundation with unified idempotency on critical writes, AI apply/undo protection, Webhook fast ACK, and worker leases against stale writeback.
