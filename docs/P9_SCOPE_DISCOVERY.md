## Canonical scope

Douyin Shop Phase 9 is the inventory sync MVP with SKU binding calibration and manual binding fallback.

- inventory sync uses the existing inventory orchestration
- SKU calibration uses `product.detail` with `show_draft=true`
- manual bind and unbind handle `ambiguous` and `unmatched` rows
- inventory sync does not guess missing platform SKU IDs
- P9-101 through P9-402 remain the planning / governance foundation
- P9-501 through P9-1105 are the product implementation range, but implementation is not started
- multi-warehouse, auto-replenish, scheduled auto sync, and P10-only capabilities stay out of scope
